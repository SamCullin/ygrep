# Changelog

All notable changes to ygrep will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-26

### Fix
- Fixed issue where `--path` filter was not working as expected
- Fixed issue where `--ext` filter was not working as expected
### Added
- Pretty output can now optionally show relevance percentages and match indicators when `--scores` is provided, bringing score visibility to human-readable output.
- Nix build support

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-10

### Changed
- Unified shorthand and `search` subcommand options - both now support all search flags (`-r`, `-e`, `-p`, `--text-only`)
- Shorthand query is now a single argument instead of variadic, fixing option parsing issues

### Fixed
- Fixed `-r` flag not working when placed after query in shorthand form

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Regex search support with `-r` / `--regex` flag
- Match type indicators in output: `+` (hybrid), `~` (semantic only), none (text only)
- Sticky index mode - `--semantic` and `--text` flags are remembered for future `index` and `watch` commands
- Helpful error messages when searching unindexed workspaces (shows how to index)

### Changed
- Replaced `--format ai|json|pretty` with simpler `--json` and `--pretty` flags
- Improved CLI help with detailed descriptions and usage examples
- Updated AI tool integration skills with new output format documentation

### Fixed
- Fixed stray "unknown" indexes being created when opening unindexed workspaces
- Fixed workspace detection to properly distinguish indexed vs unindexed workspaces
- Prevented `Workspace::open()` from creating empty index directories

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed
- Renamed `--embeddings` flag to `--semantic` for clarity
- Changed user-facing terminology from "embedding" to "semantic" throughout
- Progress bar now displays correctly (model loads before bar starts)

### Fixed
- Fixed line numbers in hybrid search showing top of file instead of match location
- Fixed `-n` limit not working with shorthand query form (`ygrep -n 5 query`)
- Fixed UTF-8 panic when displaying results with non-ASCII characters

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-09

### Changed
- Optimized vector index loading (3+ seconds → ~5ms) using native HNSW dump/load
- Removed embedding daemon (no longer needed after optimization)

### Fixed
- Fixed UTF-8 character boundary panic in search results

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- Various performance improvements and bug fixes

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-07

### Changed
- Version bump for release

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Hybrid search combining BM25 and vector similarity
- `--embeddings` flag to build semantic index during indexing

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-05

### Changed
- Switched to rustls for easier cross-platform builds
- Removed OpenSSL dependency

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-04

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-03

### Added
- Initial release
- Tantivy-based full-text indexing with BM25 ranking
- Code-aware tokenizer preserving `$`, `@`, `#` as part of tokens
- Literal text matching (like grep, not regex)
- File watching for incremental index updates
- Symlink handling with cycle detection
- AI-optimized output format
- Index management commands (`indexes list`, `indexes clean`, `indexes remove`)
- Client integrations for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Factory Droid
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)

### Fixed
- Fixed cross-platform debouncer type for Linux builds
- Fixed file watcher to follow symlinks correctly
- Deduplicated watch events for same file
